## Description:
This is a weather app midterm for the MDIA - Advanced Dynamic and Content Design Class. The app is designed to use openweather API to grab weather data for the current weather as well as the 5 day 3 hour forecast. The app is called Bruther as a play on word for Bruh and weather; as the tagline suggests, it is a weather app for the bros.
